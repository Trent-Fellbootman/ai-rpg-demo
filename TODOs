- Optimize next scene generation TTFT (Time To First Token).
Generate event first, then generate narration and image prompt in parallel from the event.
Stream the narration to the user.
This should reduce TTFT to about 2s, and the total processing time to about 6s.
- Allow games to specify a win condition.
This would make things more interesting
and the very-hard-to-beat games would probably enhance the social networking effect
(like "Yo check this out, I beat this game this way!").
