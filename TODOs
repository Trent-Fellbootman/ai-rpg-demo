- Prevent image to be cloned each time a game template is updated
- Add better handling for empty action input when generating next scene
(currently it clears the view and throws an error, preventing the user from taking further actions)
- Likes and comments are not updated correctly when user navigates away from the game template overview
- Allow games to specify a win condition.
This would make things more interesting
and the very-hard-to-beat games would probably enhance the social networking effect
(like "Yo check this out, I beat this game this way!").
